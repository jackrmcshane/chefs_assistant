PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Chef's Assistant system attempt to model the human creative process using a rule-based suggestion module.
Given a recipe, the ingredients to be substituted, and the desired level of creativity, the system generates creative ingredients to replace those given in the input.
The input recipe is then modified by the system and the new recipe then returned to the user.

The aim of the system is to serve as a blueprint for larger scale component systems that might be incorporated in systems akin to those from the Computer Cooking Contest


PROGRAM USAGE

The program takes x command-line arguments
FIRST ARG: the first argument to the program should be a text file containing the recipie to be modified in a Lisp-like format

SECOND ARG: the second argument to the program are the ingredients from the original recipe that are to be substituted

THIRD ARG: the third argument to the program should be the desired degree of creativity that the system should use in generating substitute ingredients
